# IPLAnalytica
## Description
Welcome to IPLAnalytica Web App!
* This project is a data analysis and visualization tool for exploring statistics related to the **Indian Premier League (IPL) Cricket data**. 

* The project provides insights into player and team performances, match statistics, and an added functionality to generate scorecard of a particular match.

* The project is built upon the [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app framework to create a web app and help users better understand the insights gained from the data analysis of the [IPL Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020) using Python's [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library.

* To find images for players/stadiums/team logos the project uses the [Google-Images-Search](https://pypi.org/project/Google-Images-Search/) Python library that uses Google [Custom Search API](https://console.developers.google.com/).

## Lessons Learned
* The IPL Analytics Project provided valuable experience in **cleaning, filtering, and extracting insights** from large datasets using Pandas. 

* The implementation involved applying advanced **data manipulation techniques, including filtering, grouping, and aggregation**, to derive meaningful patterns and trends from the data. 

* To improve performance, the csv files were cleaned and converted to **.parquet data** files which greatly boosts the data reading/writing operations.

* The project also demonstrated the effective use of **Streamlit for deploying an interactive web application**, enabling seamless presentation of insights to users. 

## Known Issues/Bugs
1. UI not optimized to view from a phone.  
2. Player images might not exactly match the name of the player (though very few cases).  
â†’ This is because the data had the names of the palyers with First name initial and last name.  
â†’ For ex. A player named "T Kohli" had the same image as "V Kohli".  
â†’ This is because I used google_images_search api to extract these images and it is not feasible to check that each and every player's image matches its name.
